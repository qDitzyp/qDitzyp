# Project Title

Project 4: gametime

## Project Description

This project tests ability to write object oriented code in java. It's a small game referred to as catacomb crawler and it has heros and monsters that fight eachother on a 2d tile map.

## Project Guide



### Dependencies

To run  this you would need to have all 3 classes, that being the main(app) as well as the hero and monster classes. 

### How to run the project

You would run the app class which contains the actual gameplay loop.

### How to play the game

The game is played by using the directions north, south, east, and west to mover the character across the tile map. It will show you whether there are monsters nearby, going to the same tile as the monsters initiates a battle where you and the monster fight to the death. If your hp hits 0 you lose, but if you reach the bottom right of the map then you win. Somewhere random in the map is also a new sword, if you pick it up you do more damage!

## Lessons Learned

- I understand the use of classes and methods a lot better now, especially in the case of classes.
- Since I had to rewrite quite a bit of it I gained a better understanding of the different ways programs can be written.
- One of the biggest bugs I ended up having was an issue where going to the bottom of the map would cause the program to stop, I learned how to better go through the debugging process while trying to fix it.
